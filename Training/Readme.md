# How to use

## Training Classification
To train the classifier, we need 'train_Classifier.csv' generated by the noising method. The training data should be saved in the same directory of the training script.

'python trainClassification.py' to run the file.

All checkpoints will be saved in  'result' folder.

## Training Encoder decoder
To train the encoder decoder model, we need 'train_new.csv' file.

'python trainEncoderDecoder.py' to start training.

All checkpoints will be saved in  'result' folder.

## Train from a pre-trained checkpoint
Save the pre-trained checkpoint in directory new/checkpoint#### and rename the model directory.

If no pre-trained checkpoint available, you can also download the 'roberta-base' checkpoint from huggingface.
